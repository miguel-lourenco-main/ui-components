## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was developed as a comprehensive solution for **UI component management and showcase**, serving three primary objectives:

1. **📦 Component Library**: Centralized storage for frequently used and custom UI components
2. **💼 Portfolio Showcase**: Professional demonstration of frontend development skills for CV/portfolio
3. **🎓 Learning Platform**: Consolidation and application of knowledge gained during internship experience

The application features an **interactive playground** where users can experiment with components, customize properties in real-time, and explore multiple design themes. The project evolved through user feedback during development, resulting in a robust, production-ready component library.

## 🤖 Automated Code Documentation

This project uses an automated code documentation workflow powered by **n8n**:

### Overview
An n8n workflow runs on an Oracle VM that automatically analyzes code changes on every push to the repository. The workflow:
- **Triggers on Push**: Automatically runs when code is pushed to the repository
- **Code Analysis**: Scans the codebase for uncommented code sections
- **Comment Generation**: Automatically generates helpful comments based on the code logic
- **Oracle VM Deployment**: Runs reliably on a dedicated Oracle virtual machine

### Benefits
- 📝 **Consistent Documentation**: Ensures code remains well-documented without manual effort
- 🔄 **Automated Process**: No need to remember to add comments manually
- 🎯 **Quality Assurance**: Helps maintain code quality standards across the project
- ⚡ **Zero Overhead**: Runs in the background without impacting development workflow

This automation helps maintain high code quality and documentation standards throughout the project lifecycle.
